# flaskApp

Navigate to the Lesson-3-Containerization directory in the Github repo(https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices).

Check out the pre-built Flask app(https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Lesson-3-Containerization/flask_app) that will be containerized. If you haven't used Flask before, you can check out this free Udacity course(https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088), or check out Flask's documentation(https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).
